# ADAS
Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) can help drivers in the driving process and increase driving safety by automatically detecting objects, doing basic classification, implementing safeguards, etc. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, are systems to help the driver in the driving process and aim at improving traffic safety. ADAS has been becoming one of the most active areas in recent years and Machine learning plays an important role in automotive fields because of its high accuracy and reliability. ADAS integrates multiple subsystems including object detection, scene segmentation, lane detection, and so on. 


Objectives:

Objective 1: To study & develop an Advanced driver-assistance system to be implemented in the project work. 

Objective 2: To study and establish a supervised learning framework on FPGA.

Objective 3: To study how the performance on an FPGA is optimized by software and hardware co-design and later to deploy the system on an FPGA board.
